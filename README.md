# ShoppingCartRestock
# Description:
### For this project, I used Strapi and PostMan for Local API to make my JSX file async and fetch the grocery stocking list.
### The webpage is able to click and add grocery item to cart, and add up the total price.
### The user also has the option to remove the item from the cart. 
### If the item is sold out, the bottom button can restock the items.

# Improve:
### For the future improvement, I would like to only restock the items that is down to zero, instead of restock all.
